### Hi there 👋

<!--**JosephPolaski/JosephPolaski** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

🖥️ I’m currently completing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at Oregon State University (Expected December 2021)

🌳 This will be my second Bachelor's Degree as I also have one in Forest Science from Penn State and I have worked as a Forester and Wildland Firefighter since 2013!

I have always loved technology and had originally intended to major in Computer Science the first time around. I started down that path, but ended up switching majors due to my love of the outdoors. Throughout my career I have seen technology permeate every sector, including Forestry. This made me realize that I could take my foundation in ecosystem managment and good stewardship, and apply it anywhere via technology. I decided to go back to school and become a Software Engineer. It has been a rewarding journey and I have learned so much. I hope to meet like-minded individuals and collaborate on projects that will create a better future!

This is my personal portfolio. I am always trying to work on new projects and improve. If you would like to connect, my LinkedIn profile link is located under my profile picture!
