### Hi there 👋

<!--**JosephPolaski/JosephPolaski** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

🖥️ My name is Joe and I am a Software Engineer

🌳 I also have a degree in in Forest Science and previously worked as a Geospatial Analyst, Forester and Wildland Firefighter for 10 years.

I am extremely interested in computer vision and augmented reality, specifically how they might be combined with geospatial data to provide useful tools in the future of natural resource management.

This is my personal portfolio, feel free to checkout my pinned repositories. I am always trying to work on new projects and improve. If you would like to connect, please reach out! My LinkedIn profile link is located under my profile picture also if you would like to connect there!
